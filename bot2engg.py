    If you‚Äôre new to Discord, you might find this guide helpful: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord
    
    And if you don't know how to change your nickname, follow this handy guide here:  https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames

    __RULES__
    1) **Change your nickname on the server to your full name and pronouns**
    If your **preferred name differs from the name in our documents** - use your preferred name here and send either @afify (he/him) or @Simon M a message letting us know :)
    2) Be polite and mindful of other's feelings
    3) Respect pronouns and diversity
    4) Don't bully, harass or be toxic in general
    5) Keep the chat SFW (including profile pictures)
    6) Do not spam text or advertise
    7) Personal attacks will result in banning from server for a period of time or permanently, based on the situation

    __Academic Integrity Rules__
    Don't share exam materials, solutions to assignments, or any other materials that would give some students an unfair advantage. The university is very strict with these rules, and some will find it is much better just to receive the lower grade than to be faced with academic misconduct.

    Please react :white_check_mark: once you read the server rules AND changed your nickname to your real name & pronouns to access the other channels!

    If you've changed your nickname and you've paid for some B2E services - let us know by reacting :pencil: if you're in Academic Essentials and :camping: if you're in Engg Camp. We will then verify this and add you to your specific channels :)
